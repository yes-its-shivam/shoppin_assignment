# AI Shoppin Assistant

## Comparative Conceptual Map
We analyzed various approaches to building a shopping assistant, comparing:
- **Machine Learning Models**: ML-based recommendation engines that improve with data but require training.
- **LLM-Powered Agents**: Our approach leverages a large language model to interpret queries dynamically, offering greater adaptability.

| Approach                | Pros                                           | Cons                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Rule-Based Systems      | Simple, deterministic, explainable           | Limited adaptability, high maintenance        |
| Machine Learning Models | Data-driven, improves over time              | Requires extensive training and labeled data  |
| LLMs                    | not flexible and robust, hallucinate         | require more context, or maybe finetuning     |
| LLM-Powered Agents      | Flexible, context-aware, requires no training| Can generate unexpected responses sometimes  |

## Short Written Analysis
Our AI shopping assistant demonstrates strong performance in:
- **Accuracy**: High precision in understanding queries.
- **Efficiency**: Fast response times due to pre-structured tools.
- **User Experience**: Seamless interaction without requiring pre-defined templates.

However, areas for improvement include response consistency and error handling for ambiguous queries.

## Design Decisions
- **Agent Architecture**: Uses Ollama to process queries and map them to predefined tool calls.
- **Tool Selection**: Functions in `tools.py` handle core shopping operations, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- **LLM Agent**: Defined agent in `agent.py` handle core query parsing, understaning, and robustness.
- **Logging**: Implements JSON-based logging for debugging and analytics.

## Challenges & Improvements
**Challenges Faced:**
1. Handling ambiguous queries requiring contextual understanding.
2. Efficiently mapping natural language to structured tool calls.
3. Ensuring consistent responses across different query formats.

**Improvements Implemented:**
- Optimized regex-based parsing for tool calls.
- Enhanced logging for future usecases and finetunings.

## Open Questions & References
- How can we further improve accuracy for vague queries?
- What can be used to make it more robust, over different runs agent tends to answer incompletely
